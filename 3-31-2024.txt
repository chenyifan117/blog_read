Title: Do not over-think about ‘outliers’, use a student-t distribution instead

Traditional statistical models are built on Gaussian distributions. This has an inherent assumption that all data points will cluster around a central mean in a predictable pattern based on the central limit theorem.

Since gaussian distributions are sensitive to extreme observations, and people believe that eliminating extreme observations is the best way to get clearer and cleaner results. Student's t-distribution is a more adaptable vessel to navigate the turbulent seas of real-world data.

Student's t-distribution is nothing more than a Gaussian distribution with heavier tails. Hence, it assigns greater probability to events further from the mean.
